## Description

###### The AI Factory Client is the front-end component of the AI Factory system responsible for providing a user-friendly interface and facilitating user interactions with the underlying machine learning capabilities. Its primary responsibilities include:
1. User Interface (UI) Design: The client is responsible for designing and presenting the graphical user interface through which users interact with the AI Factory system. This includes creating visually appealing layouts, input forms, and result displays.
2. Displaying Results: The client displays the results generated by the AI Factory Server in a clear and comprehensible manner. This may involve visualizations, reports, or any other output relevant to the user's query or request.
3. User Authentication and Authorization: If the AI Factory requires user accounts and access control, the client handles user authentication and authorization processes. It ensures that users have the appropriate permissions to access specific features or data.
4. Communication with Server: The client communicates with the AI Factory Server through API requests. It sends user input to the server, receives predictions or results, and updates the UI accordingly. This interaction is crucial for seamless collaboration between the client and server components.
