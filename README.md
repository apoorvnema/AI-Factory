## Description

######  The AI Factory Server is a component of the AI Factory system responsible for handling backend operations and facilitating the core functionalities of the system. Its primary responsibilities include:
1. API Endpoints: The server exposes API endpoints that enable communication with other components of the system, such as the client and potentially other servers or services. These endpoints allow for the retrieval of predictions, submission of training data, and interaction with machine learning models.
2. Integration with External Services: It may integrate with external services or APIs to enhance its capabilities. This could involve using pre-trained models from external sources, accessing additional datasets, or leveraging specialized machine learning tools.
